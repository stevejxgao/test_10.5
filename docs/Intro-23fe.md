### CHIP 10.5: Agile Iterations

Welcome to CHIP 10.5!

To get started navigate to https://classroom.github.com/a/lO9qwvXw, accept the invitation, and create a group if one already doesn't exist with the name being your group number in two digits (i.e. when you type 06 a repo named hw-agile-iterations-fa21-06 will be created). Only one person needs to create a group, the rest of the team members just have to join the group. 

**Do not make team names that do not match your team number**. These will be deleted and any work you have there will not be saved. So, for example if John and Jane Doe are in the same team numbered 0, then John (or Jane) should navigate to the GitHub classroom link and create group numbered 00. Then Jane (or John) should go to the same link and find the group and click join. 

After successfully finishing the GitHub classroom setup you should be prompted to your team repo. Open a terminal window from Tools > Terminal, and clone your team's repo. 

Then, navigate to the next page to get started with Part 1.
