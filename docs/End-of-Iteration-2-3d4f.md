That's it, you are almost done with the final project! Once again, submit the bCourses assignments ([Self-assessment survey](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1507976/quizzes/2367532), [Peer Review](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1507976/quizzes/2378818), and [Retrospective](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1507976/quizzes/2367480)).

At this point you should have finished all tasks for Iteration 2 and have higher than 70% test coverafe. The GSIs will be checking your code functionality as well as coverage and scaling iteration grades accordingly if you miss any of the tasks or have low coverage. 

That sums up the final project, we hope you had fun!
